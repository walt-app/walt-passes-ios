/// kill the isolated decode *process*; iOS cannot, so this bounds the *wait*: a slow or hung Vision
/// decode stops blocking the caller at the budget, and its result is discarded.
///
/// Honest about what it can and cannot do: `VNImageRequestHandler.perform` is synchronous and does
/// not observe cancellation mid-flight, so on timeout the operation runs on to completion on its
/// decode lane and its result is dropped. That is acceptable because the roster clamp and the
/// bounded ``BoundedImageDecode`` keep the actual work bounded — the timeout exists to bound how
/// long the caller *waits*, not to forcibly reclaim CPU.
///
/// Implemented with a resolve-once continuation rather than a `withTaskGroup` race: a structured
/// group would await *both* children before the closure returns, so the slow operation would still
/// block the caller past the deadline.

/// parking its threads can stop a pool-scheduled decode from ever starting while the deadline still
/// fires, reporting a timeout for work never attempted. See ADR `barcode-decode-1` (ipass-f8p).
